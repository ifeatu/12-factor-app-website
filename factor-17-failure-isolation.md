# Factor 17: Failure Isolation

## Design for failure and implement resilience patterns

### Modern Principle

In distributed systems, failure is not an exceptionâ€”it's the norm. Modern applications must be designed to gracefully handle failures, isolate them to prevent cascading effects, and recover automatically when possible.

#### Core Resilience Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources
- **Timeout**: Prevent hanging operations
- **Retry with Backoff**: Handle transient failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against overload
- **Health Checks**: Monitor service health

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Implement circuit breakers** for external service calls
2. **Use timeouts** for all network operations
3. **Apply bulkhead pattern** to isolate critical resources
4. **Implement graceful degradation** when dependencies fail
5. **Use chaos engineering** to test failure scenarios
6. **Monitor and alert** on failure patterns
7. **Implement automatic recovery** where possible

### Failure Types

- **Transient Failures**: Temporary network issues, timeouts
- **Intermittent Failures**: Sporadic service unavailability
- **Permanent Failures**: Service shutdown, configuration errors
- **Cascading Failures**: Failure propagation across services
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory, CPU, or connection limits

### Modern Tools

- **Circuit Breakers**: Hystrix, Resilience4j, Polly
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
- **Load Balancers**: HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ALB
- **Chaos Engineering**: Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, Litmus
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog

### Resilience Strategies

- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report failures quickly
- **Fail Safe**: Maintain safe state during failures
- **Fail Silent**: Continue operating with reduced functionality
- **Fail Loud**: Alert operators to critical failures
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically restart or heal failed components

### Testing for Failure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual component failures
- **Integration Tests**: Test service interaction failures
- **Chaos Engineering**: Inject failures in production
- **Load Testing**: Test behavior under stress
- **Disaster Recovery**: Test full system recovery

### Anti-patterns

- Assuming the network is reliable
- Not implementing timeouts on external calls
- Cascading failures due to tight coupling
- Not testing failure scenarios regularly
- Ignoring partial failures and edge cases
- Not having proper monitoring and alerting
